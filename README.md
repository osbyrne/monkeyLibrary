# monkeyLibrary

Hi! We named our project Monkey Library, after the Infinite Monkey Theorem.
Because this project isn't really about dictionnaries (where are the definitions?), the 
C language (the 70's called and they want their borrowed pointers back), but about creating a beautiful mess of words, 
that hopefully make a minimum of grammatical sense.

This is what we hoped to achieve a handful of weeks ago, when we ran the 'git init' ceremony, opening the door to a
new landscape of bugs, pull request, bad comments and stack overflows.

Today's commit, hopefully our last, seals a project that settles within us the ideals and tradoffs of collaboration.
