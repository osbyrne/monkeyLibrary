To run it, simply open your terminal emulator, go to the project folder and run ./excecutable_file

Introduction au projet :
The objective of this project is to create a program that automatically generates grammatically and (as far as possible) spelling correct sentences, but which do not necessarily make sense. This program is approaching the game of "Corpse exquisite" invented by the surrealist school in 1925.

This document is a readme, it will help you to understand how to use our program.
Programation’s Language : C

Prerequisite : To use this tool you need a compiler and C code editor/reader. Comment utiliser l’outil :

### premier menu

- The first function of this menu allows you to search for a word in the tree. This returns yes or no depending on whether the word is found.
- The second function will print the 280000 words of the dictionary sorted according to their type, nouns, adjective, adverb or verb. If only the verbs are displayed, it means that your interface does not go up high enough. This is the case on VS code but not on Clion.
- The third choice “Generate Randoms Sentence” will open a new menu (menu 2).

### Le deuxième menu

- Select 1) to choose the first sentence form. This will return the sentence chosen at random from the trees created. The type 1 sentence is of this type "noun adjective verb noun" for example ( chat bleu radier homme ).
- Select 2) to choose the second sentence form. This will return the sentence chosen at random from the trees created. The type 2 sentence is of this type "noun qui verb verb noun adjective" for example ( chat qui avoir manger homme bleu )
- Select 3) (the one we created) to choose the third sentence form. This will return the sentence chosen at random from the trees created. The type 3 sentence is of this type "noun adverb adjective verb " for example(chat tout bleu dort)
- Select 4) to go back to the main menu.
